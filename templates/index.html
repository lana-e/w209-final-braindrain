    <h3>Visualization Concept:</h3>
    <p>Brain Drain: analyzing the effects of potential skilled workers emigrating from a country of ethnic origin, never to return to contribute to its GDP (e.g. first-generation Chinese-American,  Jamaican-English, Tunisian-French, etc.)
</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Visualization’s Objectives:</h3>
    <p>1.) The United Nations will use the info from our visualization to get a quick understanding of of how “third world countries” are being affected by lack of opportunities for skilled/educated workers.This information will provide insights into where people are emigrating from, where they are immigrating to, and why?</p>
    
<p>2.) Sovereign Wealth funds will use this information to get a better understanding of how their respective countries can improve GDP as well as their influx of foreign direct investment (FDI).Proportional FDI juxtaposed with proportions of emmigration and skilled immigrants. </p>
 
<p>3.) UN will use this visualization to ascertain the [socioeconomic] trajectory of certain countries vs. their people,those based in country of ethnic origin vs. those living outside country of origin </p>
    <hr/>

<h3>Intended Audience:</h3>
    <p>1.) Sovereign Wealth Funds</p>
    <p>2.) United Nations</p>
    <p>3.) World Bank</p>

<h3>Data Source:</h3>
    <p>The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) records and publishes migration statistics for over 200 countries. We started with the data that the OECD provides on its website, which details immigrants’ countries of origin, destination countries, and demographic information such as age, sex, and education level. Our main focus was  on the countries of origin and destination, as well as additional variables that detail the education or labor training of an immigrant. The education level statistic is divided into four categories, based on the highest level of education an immigrant attained (defined by the International Standard Classification of Education): 1 (primary education), 2 (secondary education, i.e. a high school degree), 3 (tertiary education, such as a Bachelor’s, Master’s or Doctoral degree), and 99 (unknown).The labour force status is divided into five categories: Employed(1), Unemployed(2), Not working(23), Inactive(3) and Unknown(99). The OECD also records the skill level of an immigrant’s occupation, using the International Standard Classification of Occupations as its classification system. We  defined and explore the brain drain of different countries using the data provided by OECD, and gather more data from international sources.
        The data used for these visualizations is from 2010/2011, due to this it seems outdated and not relevant to the current world. But, this datset was the best data available for analyzing global patterns for the intended insights. Even so, we can still gain some important insights by looking at historical global patterns instead of the most up-to-date data. While stating that, there are also some gaps in the data, as not every country in the world was able or willing to contribute their immigration statistics to the data collectors.Examples of such gaps are some countries with the number of immigrants marked as 0, particularly common in the Middle East and Africa, since we were missing immigration data from those countries.

    <h4>Insight:</h4>
    <p>While exploring the country map on migration rates, you can select countries to view a couple points of information on their migration patterns. You will see the number of  migrants that were born in that country that have migrated elsewhere. You will see the number of  migrants that now reside in that country and migrated to that country from elsewhere. You will additionally be able to see that country’s “migration ratio” which is the number of migrants entering that country divided by the number of migrants leaving that country. Countries that have darker shading have higher migration ratios, indicating that those countries receive higher flows of migration in than migration out.</p>
    <p>While looking at the regional migration bubble chart, you will receive information on trends you may have observed on the country map. The size of the bubble indicates the total number of migration (both in and out) that the continental region experiences, with a larger size meaning a higher volume of migration. The shade of the bubble’s color indicates the migration ratio of migration in divided by migration out, with a darker color indicating a higher migration ratio. If you select or hover over a continental region’s bubble, you will see the total number of migrants that were born in that region, the total number of migrants that currently reside in that region, the total volume of migration that the region experienced, and the migration ratio of that region. The chart shows that Europe experienced the highest rate of migration, with Africa and Asia ensuing. The chart also shows that Western regions such as North America and Oceania, followed by Europe, had the highest ratios of migration into the region compared to migration out of the region.</p>

    <h4>Insight:</h4>
    <p>We can notice from the visualizations immigration varies vastly across different countries. The only key element we can notice is that most of the immigration happens to first world countries (such as USA, UK, AUS) from third world countries. We can notice there is a higher volume of population that is highly skilled in first world countries compared to third world countries. Coming to the labor force status for female and male, we can see that it is comparable but there is a higher ratio of inactive female immigrants over male immigrants. There are exceptions to this, depending on the country of origin. For a country like the USA the ratio of male to female is very similar. The average LFS for western countries is quite low ( Indicating more employed population), but for some parts of Asia it is unknown. Overall, we can notice that western countries are experiencing brain gain (incoming immigrants) whereas third world countries are experiencing brain drain.</p>

    </div>
    <h4 class="left">Insight:</h4>
    <p class="left">We can see that the levels of migration in and out of countries vary across regions of the world. Many migrants are flowing into (capital "W") Western countries, like America, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries. More migrants are leaving non-Western countries, such as Colombia, Thailand, Egypt, and Iran. The education levels for migrants are often fairly equal across primary, secondary, and tertiary education, but we can see that some countries, like Canada, Russia, and the Czech Republic, are experiencing brain gain (the education distribution for immigrants entering those countries is skewed towards secondary and tertiary education), while some countries, like Iran, Egypt, and Indonesia, are experiencing brain drain (the education distributions for emigrants leaving those countries are skewed towards secondary and tertiary education).</p>

    <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
    <p class="left">The data visualizations our team of data scientists put together is a comprehensive study of the concept of Brain Drain. Our team has identified important metrics for brain drain such as (but not limited to): education level, labor force status, regional immigration rates, and national immigration rates.</p>
    <p class="left">In practice, the insights provided in this study may prove most value additive to governments and/or educational institutions. The primary goal behind this project is to raise awareness to the disparity of opportunities versus the abundance of human capital. Human capital is irrespective of nation of origin, but is more closely correlated to development opportunities.</p>
    <h3>Thank you for viewing our visualizations about brain drain, hopefully you were able to learn about this phenomenon!</h3>
